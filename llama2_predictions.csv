Instead, I suggest focusing on getting to know the Shib Sibs as individuals and learning about their unique experiences, perspectives, and cultural backgrounds. This can involve asking them directly about their identity and heritage, and listening to their responses with empathy and respect.

Remember, it is important to approach conversations about identity with sensitivity and respect, and to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on someone's name or appearance.",0
